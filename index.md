## About Me

I’m a Mechanical Engineer specializing in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and thermohydraulics. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a range of simulation projects, tackling complex fluid and heat transfer challenges.

On this site, you'll find a showcase of my key projects and simulations. Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration.
