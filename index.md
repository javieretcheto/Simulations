## Featured Projects

### <img src="assets/icon-1.png" alt="Icon" style="width:100px; vertical-align:middle;"/> [Conjugate Heat Transfer of a Compressible Fluid](CHT-CF.md)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    In this project, we analyze a compressible airflow involving Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) using CFX. The study focuses on a laminar internal flow of air drawn from a cloud chamber (AIDAd) to an aerosol spectrometer (Welas), where it undergoes heating during circulation. This heating can be detrimental to water and ice particles...
